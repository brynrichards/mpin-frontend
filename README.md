The M-Pin System consists of two groups of Services - Customer-hosted Services and CertiVox-hosted Services.

The third, but no less important component, is the Client. Currently there are two clients available - the Browser Client, also called the PIN Pad, and the Mobile Client, known as the Mobile App

PIN Pad

The PIN Pad is a JavaScript software component that should be integrated into the Customer's Application Web Page. The PIN Pad encapsulates all the operations and logic that needs to be performed at the front-end, in order to register and authenticate an end-user.

Mobile App

The Mobile App is a JavaScript application, much similar to the PIN Pad. The Mobile App also carries out the operations needed to register and authenticate an end-user, but the user is authenticated to a browser session, rather than to a session on the mobile device.
