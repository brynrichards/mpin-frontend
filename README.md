The **M-Pin System** consists of two groups of Services - Customer-hosted Services and CertiVox-hosted Services.

The third, but no less important component, is the *Client*. Currently there are two clients available - the Browser Client, also called the *PIN Pad*, and the *Mobile Client*, known as the Mobile App

**PIN Pad**

The PIN Pad is a JavaScript software component that should be integrated into the Customer's Application Web Page. The PIN Pad encapsulates all the operations and logic that needs to be performed at the front-end, in order to register and authenticate an end-user.

**Mobile App**

The Mobile App is a JavaScript application, much similar to the PIN Pad. The Mobile App also carries out the operations needed to register and authenticate an end-user, but the user is authenticated to a browser session, rather than to a session on the mobile device.

**Building the PIN Pad**

1. NOTE: You might have to update your package distribution system. For Ubuntu you would need to do: `sudo apt-get update`
2. Install *SASS*
  1. Install *ruby*. For instance on an Ubuntu machine you would need to do: `sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1`
  2. `sudo gem install sass`
3. Install *Node Package Manager* and *Node*. For instance on Ubuntu you need to do:
  1. `sudo apt-get install npm`
  2. `sudo npm install -g n`
  3. `sudo n 0.10.33`. NOTE that you need *curl* installed to do this.
4. Install *grunt* and the required modules
  1. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
5. Install *handlebars* and the required modules
  1. `sudo npm install -g handlebars`
6. Checkout/Clone the repository to `<work-dir>`
7. Install the locally required modules for Node
  1. `cd <work-dir>/browser`
  2. `sudo npm install`
8. Create `settings.json` file
  1. `cp settings.json_build settings.json`
9. Build the app
  1. `grunt build`

The built app should be placed in `<work-dir>/build/out/browser`.

**NOTE** that the `settings.json` file that was created above, should be modified with the correct base URL for the PIN Pad resources and with the desired template. For more details see the bellow documentation.
