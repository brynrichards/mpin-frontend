The **M-Pin System** consists of two groups of Services - Customer-hosted Services and CertiVox-hosted Services.

The third, but no less important component, is the *Client*. Currently there are two clients available - the Browser Client, also called the *PIN Pad*, and the *Mobile Client*, known as the Mobile App

**PIN Pad**

The PIN Pad is a JavaScript software component that should be integrated into the Customer's Application Web Page. The PIN Pad encapsulates all the operations and logic that needs to be performed at the front-end, in order to register and authenticate an end-user.

**Mobile App**

The Mobile App is a JavaScript application, much similar to the PIN Pad. The Mobile App also carries out the operations needed to register and authenticate an end-user, but the user is authenticated to a browser session, rather than to a session on the mobile device.

**Building the PIN Pad**

1. Install *SASS*
  1. `sudo gem install sass`
  2. Install *ruby*. For instance on an Ubuntu machine you would need to do: `sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1`
2. Install *grunt* and the required modules
  1. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
  2. `sudo npm install -g handlebars`
3. As normal user:
  1. `cd <work-dir>/browser`
  2. `npm install`
4. Create `settings.json` file
  ```
  cp settings.json_build settings.json
  ```
5. Build the app
  ```
  grunt build
  ```

The built app should be placed in `<work-dir>/build/out/browser`.

NOTE that the `settings.json` file that was created above, should be modified with the correct base URL for the PIN Pad resources and with the desired template. For more details see the bellow documentation.
